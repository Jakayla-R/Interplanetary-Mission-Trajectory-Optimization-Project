# Interplanetary-Mission-Trajectory-Optimization-Project

Explanation of Folders and Files:
gui/ Folder:

This folder contains all the code related to the graphical user interface (GUI).
main_window.py: Contains the main window setup (Tkinter setup, buttons, menus).
visualization.py: Contains the code for visualizing the trajectory using Matplotlib.
__init__.py: Allows this folder to be treated as a module, making it easier to import components elsewhere.
data/ Folder:

You can store mission data, orbital parameters, or any other relevant datasets here. This could be in CSV or other formats.
calculations/ Folder:

This is where you keep all the mathematical and physics calculations (e.g., orbital mechanics).
hohmann_transfer.py: Contains the code for calculating the Hohmann transfer orbit.
assets/ Folder:

Store any images, icons, or graphical assets that you might use in the GUI.
For example, you can use an icon for your app or a logo for your space mission.
tests/ Folder:

This folder contains unit tests that ensure the functionality of the project.
test_hohmann_transfer.py: You can add unit tests to verify the Hohmann transfer function's calculations.
Main Files:

main.py: This is the main entry point for running your application. It will call the appropriate functions from the gui/ and calculations/ modules.
README.md: Document your project, explaining how to install, run, and use the tool.
requirements.txt: List the Python libraries your project depends on (e.g., Tkinter, Matplotlib, Numpy).
